# Book Recommender System
The project aims to compare the performance of SOAP and REST web services involving a book recommendation service.

## SOAP and REST Platforms used:
SOAP platform - JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services)

REST Platform- Express.js (JavaScript - Node.js)


## Objectives:
- Develop a book recommendation service using SOAP and REST implementations.

- Test the services with different user profiles, reading preferences, and history to assess their performance.

- Measure and compare the response times and throughput of SOAP and REST services under various scenarios.

- Evaluate the scalability of both services by increasing the arrival rates of recommendation requests.

- Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of SOAP and REST in the context of a personalised recommendation service.

- Provide recommendations on when to use SOAP or REST for services involving personalised recommendations.
